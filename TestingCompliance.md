# Client & Server tests #

**Notes**:
  * Server is tested for WSDL/XML/SOAP standards conformance (using this [WSDL](http://www.web2py.com.ar/webservices/sample/call/soap?WSDL) generated online by this library, see [description web page](http://www.web2py.com.ar/webservices/sample/call/soap)).
  * Client is tested against other server/dispatcher solutions.
  * See PerformanceBenchmarks for WSDL tests comparing other solutions.

**Important**: For compliance tests use the latest development version available in the source code repository


# Soap Tools #

Web2Py (SoapDispatcher/SoapServer) tests using third party interactive SOAP applications:

See ScreenShots for examples

## SoapUI ##

  * Manual tests: All methods pass OK
  * WS-I Compliance: pass (OK)
  * SoapUI Version: 3.5
  * Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment version: 1.6.0\_18-b07
  * Operating System: Windows XP 5.1
  * XML Parser: Apache Xerces-J 2.6.2

## .NET Web Services Studio ##

  * Manual tests: all methods pass ok
  * C# autogenerated test client
  * Release: 2.0.2
  * .NET Runtime Version: 2.0.50727.3603

**Note**: UTF-16 in request message may not be recognized ("encoding specified in XML declaration is incorrect"). Use UTF-8 instead.

## Online Tools ##

  * http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv: WSDL XML validation pass OK
  * http://www.soapclient.com: all methods pass OK
  * http://xmethods.net/ve2/Tools.po: seems working OK
  * http://validwsdl.com/: seems working OK

# Client Platforms #

Web2Py (SoapDispatcher/SoapServer) tests using several programming languages:

## Python ##

  * suds: OK
  * SOAPpy: OK (except echo test)
  * ZSI: fail (cannot call any method)
  * soaplib: untested (cannot read WSDL)

**Note**: The problems with this third party python libraries are not PySimpleSoap faults, instead, they are likely not following the standards:
  * SOAPpy: echo test changes the parameter name at xml request message...
  * ZSI: reads the WSDL fine but cannot make a request message (fails with some strange internal error).
  * soaplib: WSDL client support seems deprecated or instable.

## PHP ##

  * Status: OK (all methods pass)
  * PHP Version: 5.2.6-1+lenny8
  * SimpleXML Revision: 1.151.2.22.2.39

# Server Platforms #

_comming soon_

Some preliminary SoapClient tests:
  * Java Axis: pass
  * .NET 2.0: pass
  * Java JBoss WS: pass (use namespace prefix: ie., `ns='ns1'`)
